excerpt: 'Despite the emphasis on individual uniqueness and intrinsic worth that cannot be compared, standardized metrics like test scores and competition rankings are necessary in certain contexts to fairly assess abilities or achievements relative to others, though they should not be used in isolation to make absolute judgements or comparisons between individuals.'

We are constantly reminded as we grow up that everyone has their own set of values and talents, it's just a matter of whether they have been identified or not. Each person is unique and has their own worth that cannot be compared to others. However, we frequently encounter standardised scales that appear to contradict this notion, such as test scores, competition rankings, or IELTS bands. Regardless of our personal worth, these measures are required in some contexts to make fair and consistent assessments of a person's abilities or achievements in comparison to others. It is critical to remember that these metrics are only one aspect of a person's worth and should not be used to make absolute judgements or comparisons between people. They are, rather, a tool that can be used in conjunction with other measures to better understand and evaluate a person's unique set of talents and values.

Consider each person's existence to be a unique polyhedron in an infinite space, with each face representing a different aspect of their lives. Each individual's worldview can thus be viewed as a frame of reference attached to their polyhedron. Individual relationships are represented by perpendicular projections from one polyhedron to others. If two faces of two polyhedrons exist in the same spatial dimension or are parallel in this scenario, their values can be compared to their original values. It is important to note, however, that the "slope" of the face relative to a frame of reference represents the difference between one individual's perceived and original values.

This metaphor emphasises the idea that each person has their own distinct existence and value, but how we relate to others can influence our perception of our own worth. Our interactions and comparisons with others can influence how we see ourselves, just as the slope of the projection between two polyhedrons can change the perceived value of each individual. It is critical to recognise that while we may differ from others in some ways, these differences do not automatically make us better or worse than others. They simply reflect our own unique polyhedron and the many faces that comprise our existence. We can all strive to reach our full potential and positively contribute to the world around us by understanding and embracing our own values and talents while also recognising and respecting the diversity of others.

Expanding on this idea, it's critical to recognise that each person's unique frame of reference and polyhedron of existence can make it difficult to compare and assess their worth. While it is possible to compare the value of individual A and individual B in certain contexts, such as when both are being evaluated for the same job or taking the same math test, it is critical to recognise that such comparisons can only take place within the same frame of reference.

Furthermore, when an individual's value is projected into a reference frame, their original value may be lost due to the deviation from the reference frame being compared. This means that any evaluation of an individual's worth, whether made by an organisation or by another individual, can never fully represent their true worth. Furthermore, because different organisations or individuals may have different frames of reference, each individual's perceived value can vary greatly depending on the context.

This viewpoint calls into question the notion that people can be neatly ranked or evaluated using a set of objective criteria. Instead, it emphasises the complexities and nuance of human existence, as well as the unique value that each person brings to the table. While it is tempting to compare ourselves to others or seek external validation of our worth, it is critical to remember that our worth cannot be reduced to a simple score or ranking. Rather, we must embrace our own uniqueness and recognise the inherent value of existing in this complex, infinite space.
