Have you ever found yourself feeling exhausted from the daily grind, wondering if life is simply too unfair? You're not alone. Many of us have experienced the feeling of being treated unfairly by one or more people, whether it's our boss, our colleagues, or even the world at large. It's easy to feel like the rewards we receive are not commensurate with the effort we put in or that we're being unfairly singled out for harsh treatment.

But what exactly is injustice, and where does it come from? At its core, injustice is the feeling of being treated unfairly by others. Fairness, on the other hand, refers to the handling of a situation in accordance with natural laws, social principles, national laws, and the rules of mass organizations, without interference from personal feelings or the will of others. In other words, justice is felt when we act rationally, rather than letting our emotions cloud our judgment.

Injustice can manifest itself in two ways: by acting contrary to the general rule or by feeling unfairly treated. However, it's important to note that being treated unfairly doesn't always equate to discrimination. Sometimes, we may feel that we're being treated unfairly when in fact we're being treated justly.

So why do we feel that life is unfair? Much of it has to do with comparative psychology, even if the comparisons we make are flawed. Children born into wealthy families tend to have easier lives than those born into poverty, and children born into educated families tend to be more successful than those born into manual labor. Similarly, boys may be favored over girls in some Asian families. These comparisons can lead to feelings of injustice, even if they aren't entirely accurate or fair.

Yet, we can't simply eliminate comparison altogether, as it's an inherent law of the world. Our existence is based on interrelated relationships that drive coexistence and development. Just like how light exists only in contrast to darkness, or how genius only stands out when there are fools, comparison is necessary for us to understand and appreciate the differences in the world around us. Even time exists only when there is a correlation of motion between objects.

Furthermore, injustice is not just a result of our comparisons, but is also a byproduct of nature itself. From the moment we're born, nature has already determined part of our destiny. Those born into wealthy families in developed countries will have more opportunities than those born into poverty in less developed countries. Even something as seemingly trivial as physical appearance can have a significant impact on our future relationships and career prospects. In short, "life has been unfair since we were born".

Inequity is an inherent aspect of life, a result of the interplay between intention and chance. Even the most brilliant minds can't guarantee success, as unforeseeable risks can alter their path. Thus, when preparing for success, it's vital to account for the unexpected by developing contingency plans. This is where the concept of chance comes into play; randomness generates injustice.

Efforts to reduce inequity often lead to new forms of injustice. For example, the allocation of resources to help those affected by discrimination may inadvertently create disparities between those who receive support and those who don't due to imprecise measurements or a lack of information. It's a delicate balancing act that requires careful consideration and ongoing evaluation.

Questions of fairness plague us all. Why do some suffer while others thrive? Why must children bear the consequences of their forebears' actions? But viewed from a broader perspective, life is equitable. Each individual's life is a part of a larger chain of causality, an inheritance from previous generations that shapes their present and future.

Have you ever stopped to contemplate the question, "Is life truly one's own?" It's a question that has puzzled philosophers and scholars for centuries, and one that continues to inspire debate to this day. While some argue that individuality is paramount and that each person's life is their own to shape and define, others see life as an extension of one's lineage, a continuation of a legacy passed down from previous generations.

But the truth is that life is more than just the sum of our individual experiences. It is a complex web of cause and effect, shaped by countless factors beyond our control. We are all links in an endless chain of cause and effect, and the actions of those who came before us have a profound impact on our present and future.

This may sound discouraging at first, but it's important to remember that we do have agency in our own lives. While we may not be able to control every aspect of our circumstances, we can choose how we respond to them. We can focus on what we can control - our own development and growth - and work to shape our lives in ways that align with our values and aspirations.

Of course, this is easier said than done, especially in the face of injustice. It can be tempting to dwell on the unfairness of it all, to feel frustrated and powerless in the face of systems and structures that seem to work against us. But rather than ruminating on inequities, we can choose to channel our energy into positive action. We can work to build a better future for ourselves and for those around us, one step at a time.

At the same time, we must also recognize that injustice is an inherent aspect of life. Randomness and chance can breed inequality and discrimination, and efforts to reduce inequity can sometimes create new forms of injustice. However, this doesn't mean that we should give up the fight for a more just and equitable world. Rather, we should strive to approach these challenges with humility and a willingness to learn, recognizing that the solutions are rarely straightforward or easy.

Ultimately, life is a balance between individual agency and larger social forces. We are all shaped by our lineage and our environment, but we also have the power to shape our own destinies. By focusing on what we can control and working to build a better future for ourselves and for those around us, we can create a legacy that extends far beyond our individual lives.
