excerpt: 'After quitting my PhD, I told my friends it wasn’t a rushed decision. A week later, I changed my mind and decided to return. To them, it seemed impulsive. But for me, it was a necessary emotional response to a serious mental health need. I don’t regret acting quickly—it was good for me. I value honesty with myself, even when it looks irrational to others. I act emotionally but think carefully, and I choose what feels right when the decision only affects me. This is how I live—not for approval, but for alignment with who I am.'

Last week, I told my friends that I quit my PhD, and they were shocked. They asked if it was a rushed decision, made after receiving a lot of bad news. I said “No.” But after just a week, everything changed—I now want to continue my PhD. So, from their perspective, it seems like I made a foolish decision. They advised me to think more independently before deciding anything. After reflecting carefully, if I had the chance to respond again to their concerns about why I stopped last week, I’d say: “Yes, it was a quick decision—but it was good for me.” What do I mean by that?

I don’t want to make excuses for what might seem like a stupid answer in their eyes. But I’d rather say “Yes-but-good” than just “No.” The key reason behind this is emotion. My friends were worried that my decision was too emotional. And they’re right—I do care deeply about my emotions, maybe even more than anything else. But they don’t understand how much I struggle with my mental health. I’m intense by nature, which makes mental problems hit harder. I can’t wait weeks for things to “settle down” when I’m having a mental health crisis. I need something that helps right away, and that’s more important to me than what others think about my future or career benefits. I needed to see some kind of progress or change to feel better mentally.

As for whether the decision was “too fast,” they forget that I work at a different pace. I’m naturally intense and do everything faster than most people—whether it’s research or anything else. A few days might seem rushed to others, but that’s normal for me.

Another key difference is our philosophy of life. I care a lot about happiness and emotional well-being—it’s part of my core, or as a joke, part of my ego. I think rationally, but I act emotionally. I’m fully aware of the consequences of my decisions. I just choose to follow my inner voice. But that doesn’t make me a bad person. I also think carefully about whether a decision affects just me or other people. If it only affects me, I’ll follow my emotions. But if it impacts others, I either follow the norm or at least step back, ask someone else to get involved, or make it clear that I’m emotionally involved and not making a neutral decision.

All I want is to be honest—with myself and with others. Is it good to live this way—emotionally rather than practically? Maybe not for everyone. But it works for me, and for people who feel the same. I’m not trying to convince anyone to live like this. If others want to judge it as “good” or “bad,” I’ll just call it “myself” or “not myself.” I don’t live for others. I admit I’m selfish in my own way—but at least I don’t harm anyone. I’ve spent a lot of time becoming who I am, and I live in a way that stays true to that.
