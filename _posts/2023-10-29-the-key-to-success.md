It’s safe to say that we all ponder the same significant question in life — “_what is the key to success_”? Success is a subjective concept, varying from person to person, hence there isn’t a one-size-fits-all key. However, a common denominator might exist — **independent thinking**. This article delves deeper than the conventional understanding of independent thinking, exploring an autonomous and self-governing thought process, referred to as an independent mindset.

Discussing this concept, we can identify two prevalent mindsets in society: independent and dependent. Dependent mindsets are swayed by others’ thoughts, with crucial life decisions often hinging on others’ opinions, such as parents, teachers, friends, and societal norms. On the other hand, those with independent mindsets can make significant life decisions, like pursuing education and marriage. They may seek advice from others, but the final decision stems from their own introspection. In this context, an independent mindset equates to a “mature” mindset.

Nevertheless, the independent mindset discussed in this article is more nuanced. A dependent mindset also characterizes individuals lacking leadership and management skills, those who prefer being guided by others and lack the drive to progress. They are profoundly influenced by the mindsets of other people, organizations, religions, or societal biases. They adhere to and follow pre-established norms — so how can they succeed when everyone follows the same path? Success isn’t a universal goal, but for exceptional individuals — it’s about competition, not equality. Hence, only those with creativity and independence can carve their path to success.

However, the line between dependent and independent mindsets isn’t always distinct. Many of us find ourselves at the “**paradoxical zero**” point, constantly grappling with internal contradictions and striving to resolve them. Starting from a point of zero knowledge, we gradually accumulate knowledge, but simultaneously, the conflict between theory and practice begins to surface. Personal experiences can challenge what one has learned, shaping their unique perception. The duration of this paradoxical zero phase can vary greatly.

The success secret that this article targets is personal awareness — encompassing a person’s knowledge, experience, and unique experiences he/she forges when he/she transcends the “paradoxical zero” point. This newfound understanding can influence others, potentially inspiring admiration and emulation. Consequently, in his/her domain, he/she gains confidence, comprehend the steps needed for success, and no longer fear novelty as he/she once did. It’s as if he/she’s deciphered the success code.
