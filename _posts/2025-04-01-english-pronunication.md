## 1. Consonants Sounds
Since Vietnamese lacks some English consonants, **substitutions** are needed for pronunciation.

| **English Sound** | **Example Word** | **Approximate Vietnamese Sound** | **Key Differences** |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **/p/** | pet | p (pét) | English **/p/** is **stronger** than Vietnamese **p**. |
| **/b/** | big | b (bít) | Similar, but English **/b/** is **voiced**. |
| **/t/** | ten | t (ten) | Similar, but English **/t/** has **stronger aspiration**. |
| **/d/** | dog | đ (đốc) | Close to **đ** but **stronger** at the tongue tip. |
| **/k/** | cat | c/k (cát) | English **/k/** is **stronger** than Vietnamese **c**. |
| **/g/** | go | g (gô) | Similar, but Vietnamese **g** is softer. |
| **/f/** | fun | ph (phân) | Similar but **stronger breath** in English. |

| **/s/** | sit | s (sát) | Similar, but stronger in English. |
