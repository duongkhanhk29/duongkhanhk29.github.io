I am a researcher and writer specializing in social and economic inequalities, leveraging machine learning to address socio-economic challenges within Computational Social Science. My work involves analyzing cross-national survey data from sources such as the World Value Survey, International Social Survey Programme, and European Social Survey. I focus on persistent inequalities and equality of opportunity in the digital age. My research techniques include clustering, dimension reduction, factor analysis, causal inference, random forests, social network analysis, and simulation. I am proficient in using research software including Stata, R, QGIS, and Python. Before joining UNU-Merit, I worked as a generative AI annotator in Ireland and was a research student at Maynooth University, where my thesis was fully funded by the Irish Research Council.
