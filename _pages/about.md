I am a researcher and writer specializing in social and economic inequalities, leveraging machine learning to address socio-economic challenges within **Computational Social Science**. I focus on persistent inequalities and equality of opportunity in the digital age.

My work involves analyzing cross-national survey data from sources such as the World Value Survey, International Social Survey Programme, and European Social Survey. My methodologies include clustering, dimension reduction, factor analysis, causal inference, random forests, social network analysis, and simulation, with proficiency in Stata and R.

Before joining UNU-MERIT, I worked as a generative AI annotator in Ireland and was a research student at Maynooth University, where my thesis was fully funded by the Irish Research Council.
